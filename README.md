# react-node-tdd-workshop-example

Hi! 

This is a playground for my TDD with React and Node workshop. I will write a [tic tac toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game, using Google's [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) for browser tests, and mocha for component / integration test.
